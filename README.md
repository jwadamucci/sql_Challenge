# Challenge 9

## Intitial Data Evaluation

Using Excel, the data was evaluated and initial relationships were determined.  

The tables and their relationships were then drafted using a website called quickdatabasediagrams.com.  That is a tool for sketching out relational databases, their tables and columns, and the various keys that aid in relating the tables to each other.  It is a text-based tool that creates an easily digestible diagram of the database.  
  
Both the text used to create the diagram and a screenshot of the diagram are included in this Challenge's solution:
* QuickDBDiagrams.txt
* QuickDBDiagrams.png

## Database Schema Creation

Using PostgreSQL's PGAdmin4, the employeeDB database was created and populated.  Initial data for the tables was provided in 6 CSV files.  
  
This document outlines the following executed SQL code:
* creating the tables (Table Creation)
* setting up their relationships for the employeeDB application (Establishing Foriegn Keys)
* querying the tables to extract data for analysis (Data Analysis)

## Table Creation

The following tables were created in the *public* schema:

### Employees Table

CREATE TABLE public.employees
(  
    emp_no serial NOT NULL,  
    emp_title_id character(256) NOT NULL,  
    birth_date date NOT NULL,  
    first_name character(256) NOT NULL,  
    last_name character(256) NOT NULL,  
    sex character NOT NULL,  
    hire_date date NOT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)  
  
);  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.employees  
    OWNER to postgres;  

### Titles Table

CREATE TABLE public.titles  
(  
        title_id character(256) NOT NULL,  
        title character(256) NOT NULL,  
        PRIMARY KEY (title_id)  
);

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.titles  
    OWNER to postgres;  

### Departments Table

CREATE TABLE public.departments  
(  
    dept_no character(256) NOT NULL,  
    dept_name character(256) NOT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (dept_no)  
);  

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.departments  
    OWNER to postgres;  
  
### Salaries Table
  
CREATE TABLE public.salaries  
(  
    emp_no integer NOT NULL,  
    salary integer NOT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)  
);

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.salaries  
    OWNER to postgres;  

### Department Employees Table  
  
CREATE TABLE public.dept_emp  
(  
    emp_no integer NOT NULL,  
    dept_no character(256) NOT NULL  
);  

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.dept_emp  
    OWNER to postgres;  
  
### Department Manager Table  
  
CREATE TABLE public.dept_manager  
(  
    dept_no character(256) NOT NULL,  
    emp_no integer NOT NULL  
);  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.dept_manager  
    OWNER to postgres;  
  
## Table creation complete.  
  
## Creating Foreign Keys (Establishing Relationships)  
The following foreign keys were added to establish relationships between the tables:  
  
### Department Employees Table  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.dept_emp  
    ADD CONSTRAINT "emp_no_FK" FOREIGN KEY (emp_no)  
    REFERENCES public.employees (emp_no) MATCH SIMPLE  
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION  
    ON DELETE NO ACTION  
    NOT VALID;  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.dept_emp  
    ADD CONSTRAINT "dept_no_FK" FOREIGN KEY (dept_no)  
    REFERENCES public.departments (dept_no) MATCH SIMPLE  
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION  
    ON DELETE NO ACTION  
    NOT VALID;  
  
### Department Manager Table  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.dept_manager  
    ADD CONSTRAINT "dept_no_FK" FOREIGN KEY (dept_no)  
    REFERENCES public.departments (dept_no) MATCH SIMPLE  
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION  
    ON DELETE NO ACTION  
    NOT VALID;  
  
### Employees Table  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.employees  
    ADD CONSTRAINT "emp_title_id_FK" FOREIGN KEY (emp_title_id)  
    REFERENCES public.titles (title_id) MATCH SIMPLE  
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION  
    ON DELETE NO ACTION  
    NOT VALID;  
  
### Salaries Table  
  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.salaries  
    ADD CONSTRAINT "emp_no_FK" FOREIGN KEY (emp_no)  
    REFERENCES public.employees (emp_no) MATCH SIMPLE  
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION  
    ON DELETE NO ACTION  
    NOT VALID;  
  
## End of foreign keys.  
  
## Data Analysis  
The following SQL queries were executed for data analysis:  
  
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.  
  
    SELECT e.emp_no, last_name, first_name, sex, s.salary FROM employees AS e  
        JOIN salaries AS s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;
